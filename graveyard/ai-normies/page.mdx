1. John Dewey invented normies when he created the public school.
2. The first normie factory was Mr. Dewey's University of Chicago Laboratory Schools
   (founded 1896).
3. While the normie factory may have been necessary to teach people accounting
   and so on, it has failed to achieve anything higher, and at great expense
   to the brighter minds of the past century.
4. Artificial Intelligence has fully automated normies, and the human variant is
   no longer needed.
5. It's time to shut down the normie factory!
