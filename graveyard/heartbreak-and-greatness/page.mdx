I met Molly on July 5, 2024, at my roommate's girlfriend's birthday party.
She was beautiful and we discussed Aquinas and faith and reason. I instantly
fell in love. That night I laid awake for hours thinking about her beauty and
charm. I had never experienced a limerence like this before.

The following morning, I reread the ending of *The Sorrows
of Young Werther* to prepare myself for the inevitable suicide if I could
not have her. A few hours later, the aforementioned roommate's girlfriend
was at our apartment and I made it clear that I would like to see Molly again.
The ensuing months involved constant thoughts of Molly and a tremendous anxiety
about whether I could possess the object of such great desire. As it happened,
Molly liked me too and in September of that year we began to date.

But this is not a post about Molly or about our relationship. I include the above
only to emphasize the extent of my desire for her and the deep pain involved in
our breakup (necessary as it was) last July.
