Ex ante, there are at least 4 reasons why we should expect Christian men to
underperform their secular peers in the dating market.

1. **Investment Incentives**

    A secular man's sexual reward for investing in his dating life is shorter-term,
    likelier to happen with a given woman, and comes at much lower cost in terms of
    commitment. Therefore, a secular man has a higher incentive to invest in his dating
    life.

2. **Selection Effects**

    A man who has high dating market value will receive greater sexual reward in
    the secular dating market and therefore is more likely to select out of the
    Christian pool. Conversely, a man who has low dating market value is more
    likely to stay in the Christian pool as marriage is likely his optimal strategy
    for sexual reward (albeit largely duty sex).

3. **Experience**

    Because a Christian man is only receiving his sexual reward in marriage,
    he is less likely to spend time with women with whom he does not see a
    long-term future. Therefore, he will have less experience with women,
    all else being equal.

4. **Early Marriage**

    The churches encourage men to marry young and thereby to "sell" well below
    their peak dating market value, which for a man is often in his mid-30s.
