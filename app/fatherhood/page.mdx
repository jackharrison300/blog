There are basically 3 models of being a good father out there in the wild.

1. **Quality Time**

    A man is a good father insofar as he spends quality time with his children.
    Notably, in this model there is no distinction between being a good father
    and being a good mother.

2. **Provision/Protection**

    A man is a good father insofar as he provides for and protects his family.

3. **Heroic Example**

    A man is a good father insofar as he embodies a heroic example for his
    children.

We all know (3) is the most fundamental, yet how often have men been told
by the churches that their fatherhood problem is (1) or (2)?
