Much has been written about the young men and their conversions to Rome and
Constantinople. I've gestured toward the nature of the problem in my first post,
[What Young Men Actually Want Is Prayer](/prayer).

The point of this post is not to debate justification or sola fide or penal
substitutionary atonement. But it is to explain the actual existing
interpretation of these things in Protestant evangelical churches in 2025,
and its practical implications.

"The Gospel." That's a big word. Often used in sermons and so forth. Occasionally
even defined. And it's important that we define it. Because presumably this is
the core thing involved in Christianity.

You have basically two definitions floating around:

1) The Evangelical-Protestant Gospel: Man deserves eternal hell due to his sin.
   A penal substitution on the cross atoned for this sin. So now one's cosmic
   account balance is zero.

2) The Orthodox-Catholic Gospel: Prior to the arrival of Jesus of Nazareth, the
   Messiah of the Israelites and the Logos of the Greeks, man could not know God
   in himself and participate in his divine life. Jesus, the Christ, revealed God
   as he is in himself and therefore by imitating his life and participating in
   his church, man might enter the divine life.

Ok, so you've got two different gospels here, and thus two different Christianities.
And importantly, the first one is **not actually a revelation**. It doesn't actually
reveal anything about the nature of God in himself.

So, what is the practical import of Gospel #1. At my aforementioned high school
megachurch there was a massive wall on which were a bunch of mostly unlit lightbulbs.
Whenever someone would answer the pastor's altar call and "give their life to Jesus"
(definition unclear), a new bulb would be lit.

And this was the point of Christianity.

So, the point of Christianity was to make more Christians.

This is called a recursive definition. Maybe even a multi-level marketing scheme.

So, you're telling young men to become Christians. And they're the dog chasing the car.
And then they catch the car! Lightbulb on wall! Now what?
